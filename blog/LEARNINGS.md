# Development Journey: Highs and Lows

This document captures our experiences, challenges, and successes while building the Passage Recorder app. It serves as both a reflection of our journey and a resource for others undertaking similar projects.

## Major Successes ðŸŽ‰

### Theia Integration
- Successfully created a custom widget that integrates seamlessly with Theia's architecture
- Leveraged Theia's dependency injection system for clean, maintainable code
- Achieved a modular design that separates concerns effectively

### Cross-Platform Development
- Successfully transitioned from a desktop-only app to a cross-platform solution
- Integrated Tauri for better performance and smaller bundle size compared to Electron
- Maintained a single codebase while supporting multiple platforms

### User Interface
- Created a focused, mobile-friendly interface by removing unnecessary IDE elements
- Implemented a clean, intuitive audio recording interface
- Successfully balanced functionality with simplicity

## Challenges Faced ðŸ¤”

### Theia Learning Curve
